`lace` is an all-in-one **LC3** (Little Computer 3) assembly toolchain. It will support fancy convenience features like `watch`ing,
interpreting files directly from `.asm`, a formatter and (probably) running with a copy of the original OS.

## Current features
- It assembles! The `compile` command is minimally functional. You may need an LC3 VM in order to run the resulting file.

## MacOS/Linux
TODO: Proper installation instructions  
For now, please use `cargo` to get set up. Many features are missing, so watch out!

## Windows
TODO: figure out how Windows would work at all
