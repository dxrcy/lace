`lace` is an all-in-one **LC3** (Little Computer 3) assembly toolchain. It supports (**!!WIP!!**) fancy convenience features like `watch`ing, interpreting files directly from `.asm`, a linter/formatter and running with a copy of the original OS. It also has a full-on assembler built in as part of the deal!
